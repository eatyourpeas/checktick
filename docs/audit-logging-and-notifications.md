# Audit Logging, Email Notifications, and SIEM Integration

This document specifies the logging, notification, and SIEM requirements for CheckTick's encryption and recovery system.

For a complete overview of security controls aligned with OWASP Top 10, see [Security Overview](/docs/security-overview/).

## Audit Logging Requirements

### Implementation

CheckTick uses a unified `AuditLog` model for all security-relevant events. The model is located in `checktick_app/surveys/models.py` and supports:

- **Scopes**: Organization, Survey, Security, Account
- **Severity levels**: INFO, WARNING, CRITICAL (auto-detected based on action)
- **Context capture**: IP address, user agent, actor, target user
- **Structured metadata**: JSON field for additional context

#### Logging Security Events

Use the convenience method for security events:

```python
from checktick_app.surveys.models import AuditLog

# Log a security event
AuditLog.log_security_event(
    action=AuditLog.Action.LOGIN_SUCCESS,
    actor=user,
    request=request,  # IP and user-agent extracted automatically
    message="Successful login via password",
)
```

### Events That MUST Be Logged

All key management and recovery events must create immutable audit entries.

#### Authentication Events

| Event | Severity | Required Fields |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| `login_success` | INFO | user_id, method (password/sso), ip, user_agent |
| `login_failed` | WARNING | email_attempted, reason, ip, user_agent |
| `logout` | INFO | user_id, session_duration |
| `account_locked` | CRITICAL | user_id, ip, failure_count |
| `password_changed` | CRITICAL | user_id, ip |
| `user_created` | INFO | user_id, registration_method |

#### Admin Access Monitoring (Healthcare Compliance)

For healthcare applications with access to patient data, all privileged account access (admin/staff users) receives enhanced monitoring with real-time email notifications. This provides an audit trail and enables rapid detection of unauthorized access.

**Implementation**: Authentication signal handlers in `checktick_app/core/signals.py` detect admin logins and trigger email notifications.

**Email Notifications Sent**:

| Event | Recipients | Email Template |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Admin successful login | Logged-in user + all superusers | `emails/security/admin_login_self.md` (to user)<br>`emails/security/admin_login_notification.md` (to others) |
| Admin failed login | Targeted user + all superusers | `emails/security/admin_failed_login.md` (to user)<br>`emails/security/admin_failed_login_notification.md` (to others) |

**Information Captured**:
- Account email and name
- Access level (Staff/Superuser)
- Timestamp (formatted with timezone)
- IP address (extracted via X-Forwarded-For or REMOTE_ADDR)
- User agent (browser/device, first 200 characters)
- Login result (success/failure)

**Notification Recipients**:
1. **Account owner**: Receives notification of all login attempts (successful and failed) to their account
2. **All superusers**: Receive monitoring notifications about all admin access events for security oversight

**Purpose**:
- Provides immediate awareness of privileged access to patient data
- Enables account owners to detect unauthorized access quickly
- Allows security team (superusers) to monitor for suspicious patterns
- Meets healthcare compliance requirements for audit trails
- Supports forensic investigation if unauthorized access occurs

**Related Logging**: All admin access events are also logged to `AuditLog` with severity INFO (successful) or WARNING (failed).

#### Two-Factor Authentication Events

| Event | Severity | Required Fields |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| `2fa_enabled` | INFO | user_id, method (totp), ip |
| `2fa_disabled` | CRITICAL | user_id, ip, reason |
| `2fa_verified` | INFO | user_id, method (totp/backup_code), ip |
| `2fa_failed` | WARNING | user_id, ip, failure_reason |
| `backup_codes_generated` | INFO | user_id, code_count, ip |
| `backup_code_used` | WARNING | user_id, remaining_codes, ip |

#### Survey Access Events

| Event | Severity | Required Fields |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| `survey_unlocked` | INFO | user_id, survey_id, method (password/phrase/sso) |
| `survey_unlock_failed` | WARNING | user_id, survey_id, reason |
| `survey_created` | INFO | user_id, survey_id, encryption_method |
| `survey_deleted` | WARNING | user_id, survey_id, deletion_reason |
| `kek_escrowed` | INFO | user_id, survey_id, vault_path |

#### Recovery Events (HIGH PRIORITY)

| Event | Severity | Required Fields |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| `recovery_request_submitted` | WARNING | user_id, survey_id, request_id, verification_method |
| `recovery_verification_submitted` | INFO | request_id, verification_type (photo_id/video/questions) |
| `recovery_verification_approved` | INFO | request_id, admin_id, verification_type |
| `recovery_verification_rejected` | WARNING | request_id, admin_id, rejection_reason |
| `recovery_primary_approval` | WARNING | request_id, admin_id, approval_reason |
| `recovery_secondary_approval` | WARNING | request_id, admin_id, approval_reason |
| `recovery_rejected` | INFO | request_id, admin_id, rejection_reason |
| `recovery_time_delay_started` | INFO | request_id, delay_hours, expires_at |
| `recovery_user_objection` | CRITICAL | request_id, user_id, objection_reason |

| `custodian_component_accessed` | CRITICAL | admin_id, reason, request_id |
| `vault_key_rotated` | WARNING | key_type, rotated_by |

### Audit Entry Format

All audit entries must follow this structure:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-11-30T14:30:00.000Z",
  "event_type": "recovery_executed",
  "severity": "CRITICAL",

  },
  "metadata": {
    "session_id": "session-uuid",
    "correlation_id": "correlation-uuid",
    "environment": "production"
  }
}
```

### Retention Requirements

| Log Type | Minimum Retention | Recommended | Regulation |
|----------|------------------|-------------|------------|
| Authentication | 1 year | 2 years | GDPR |
| Survey access | 1 year | 2 years | GDPR |
| Recovery events | 7 years | 10 years | Healthcare compliance |

### Admin Access Notifications (Healthcare Compliance)

For healthcare applications with patient data, all admin/staff account access is monitored with real-time email notifications. This ensures privileged access to sensitive data is transparent and enables rapid detection of unauthorized access.

#### Admin Successful Login - Notification to Self

**To**: Admin/staff user who just logged in
**Subject**: `🔒 Security Alert: Admin Login Detected - admin@example.com`

**Template**: `emails/security/admin_login_self.md`

```text
Hi John,

Your Superuser account just logged in to CheckTick.

Because this is a healthcare application with access to sensitive patient data,
we notify you of all privileged account access.

Login Details:
- Account: admin@example.com
- Access Level: Superuser
- Time: 2026-02-10 14:30:00 UTC
- IP Address: 192.168.1.100
- Device/Browser: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7)...

What to do:
If this was you, no action is needed. This is just a confirmation for your records.

If this was NOT you, someone may have accessed your account. Take immediate action:
1. Change your password immediately
2. Review your recent account activity
3. Enable two-factor authentication if not already enabled
4. Contact your system administrator
```

#### Admin Successful Login - Notification to Other Admins

**To**: All other superusers (for monitoring)
**Subject**: `Admin Access Alert: Superuser Login - admin@example.com`

**Template**: `emails/security/admin_login_notification.md`

```text
Hi Sarah,

A Superuser account has logged in to CheckTick. As a system administrator,
you receive this notification for security monitoring purposes.

Login Details:
- User: admin@example.com (John Smith)
- Access Level: Superuser
- Time: 2026-02-10 14:30:00 UTC
- IP Address: 192.168.1.100
- Device/Browser: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7)...

What to do:
If this access is expected, no action is needed.

If this access seems suspicious or unexpected:
1. Contact the user to verify this was them
2. Review recent account activity logs
3. Check for any unusual data access patterns
4. If unauthorized, immediately disable the account and investigate
```

#### Admin Failed Login - Notification to Targeted User

**To**: Admin/staff user whose account was targeted
**Subject**: `🔒 Security Alert: Failed Login Attempt to Your Superuser Account`

**Template**: `emails/security/admin_failed_login.md`

```text
Hi John,

Someone attempted to log in to your Superuser account on CheckTick but failed.

Because your account has privileged access to patient data, we immediately
notify you of any failed login attempts.

Attempt Details:
- Account Targeted: admin@example.com
- Access Level: Superuser
- Time: 2026-02-10 14:35:00 UTC
- IP Address: 203.0.113.45
- Device/Browser: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)...
- Result: ❌ Login Failed

What to do:
If this was you, make sure you're using the correct password and try again.

If this was NOT you, someone may be attempting to access your account:
1. ⚠️ Change your password immediately
2. Review your recent account activity
3. Enable two-factor authentication if not already enabled
4. Check if the IP address or location seems suspicious
5. Contact your system administrator if you suspect unauthorized access

Security Measures:
Your account will be automatically locked after multiple failed login attempts.
Other system administrators have also been notified of this event.
```

#### Admin Failed Login - Notification to Other Admins

**To**: All superusers (for security monitoring)
**Subject**: `🚨 Security Alert: Failed Superuser Login Attempt - admin@example.com`

**Template**: `emails/security/admin_failed_login_notification.md`

```text
Hi Sarah,

A failed login attempt was detected on a Superuser account in CheckTick.
As a system administrator, you receive this notification to help monitor for
potential security threats.

Attempt Details:
- Account Targeted: admin@example.com (John Smith)
- Access Level: Superuser
- Time: 2026-02-10 14:35:00 UTC
- IP Address: 203.0.113.45
- Device/Browser: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)...
- Result: ❌ Login Failed

What to do:
Failed login attempts on privileged accounts may indicate:
- Legitimate user forgot their password
- Brute force attack attempt
- Compromised credentials from another breach
- Internal security testing

Recommended Actions:
1. Contact the user to verify if this was them
2. Check audit logs for patterns or repeated attempts
3. Review the IP address for known threats or suspicious location
4. If multiple failures occur, consider temporarily locking the account
5. If attack is confirmed, block the IP address at firewall level

Automated Protections:
The account will be automatically locked after 5 failed attempts.
The user and all administrators are notified of both failed attempts and account lockouts.
```

**Implementation**: Configured in `checktick_app/core/signals.py` using Django authentication signals (`user_logged_in`, `user_login_failed`). Email templates use Django's internationalization framework for multi-language support.

### Alert Rules

Configure these alerts in your SIEM:

#### Critical Alerts (Immediate Response)

```yaml
alerts:
  - name: recovery_user_objection
    description: User reported unauthorized recovery attempt
    condition: event_type == "recovery_user_objection"
    severity: critical
    action:
      - page_on_call
      - create_incident
      - freeze_account

  - name: custodian_component_accessed
    description: Offline custodian component was used
    condition: event_type == "custodian_component_accessed"
    severity: critical
    action:
      - notify_security_team
      - log_to_compliance

  - name: high_recovery_rate
    description: Unusual number of recovery requests
    condition: count(event_type == "recovery_request_submitted") > 10 in 24h
    severity: critical
    action:
      - investigate
      - consider_disabling_recovery
```

#### Warning Alerts

```yaml
alerts:
  - name: elevated_recovery_rate
    description: Above-normal recovery requests
    condition: count(event_type == "recovery_request_submitted") > 5 in 24h
    severity: warning
    action:
      - notify_admins

  - name: failed_verification_attempts
    description: Multiple failed identity verifications
    condition: count(event_type == "recovery_verification_rejected" AND target.id == $user_id) > 2 in 24h
    severity: warning

    severity: warning
    action:
      - review_admin_activity
```

### Dashboard Requirements

#### Platform Admin Logs Dashboard

The Platform Admin Logs dashboard (`/platform-admin/logs/`) provides superusers with a unified interface for viewing both application audit logs and infrastructure logs. This interface is essential for:

- **DPST Compliance**: Quarterly log reviews with the Data Protection Officer (DPO)
- **Security Monitoring**: Real-time visibility into authentication events and admin actions
- **Incident Investigation**: Correlating application events with infrastructure logs

**Application Logs Tab:**
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Timestamp | When the event occurred |
| Action | Event type (login, logout, admin action, etc.) |
| User | Who performed the action |
| Details | Additional context |
| Severity | INFO, WARNING, CRITICAL |

**Infrastructure Logs Tab:**
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Timestamp | When the log was generated |
| Level | Log level (debug, info, warn, error) |
| Instance | Container/pod identifier |
| Message | Log message content |

Both tabs support filtering by severity and pagination for large result sets. The dashboard displays summary statistics at the top for quick overview.

**Access Control:** Only platform superusers can access this dashboard. All access is logged.

**Quarterly Review Process:**
1. CTO and DPO schedule quarterly review session
2. Review CRITICAL and WARNING events in Application Logs
3. Review ERROR events in Infrastructure Logs
4. Document findings and any required actions
5. Update security policies as needed

#### SIEM Integration (Optional)

Create these dashboards in your SIEM for additional monitoring:

#### Recovery Operations Dashboard

| Widget | Type | Data |
|--------|------|------|
| Recovery requests (24h) | Counter | Count of `recovery_request_submitted` |
| Recovery rate trend | Line chart | Daily recovery requests over 30 days |
| Pending requests | Table | Open requests with status |
| Time to completion | Histogram | Duration from request to completion |
| Verification methods | Pie chart | Breakdown by verification type |
| Recovery by tier | Bar chart | Individual vs Team vs Org |

#### Security Monitoring Dashboard

| Widget | Type | Data |
|--------|------|------|
| Failed logins (24h) | Counter | `user_login_failed` events |
| User objections | Alert | `recovery_user_objection` events |
| Admin actions | Table | All admin recovery actions |
| Custodian access | Timeline | `custodian_component_accessed` events |
| Geographic anomalies | Map | Login locations by IP |
| Authentication methods | Pie chart | Password vs SSO vs MFA |
