## 4. Refund Policy

### 4.1 General Refund Policy

We want you to be happy with CheckTick. If you're not satisfied, we may grant refunds at our discretion beyond the statutory 14-day period. Contact us at [support@checktick.com](mailto:support@checktick.com) to discuss your situation.

Refunds are processed through Paddle, our Merchant of Record. This does not affect your statutory rights as a consumer in relation to products which are not as described, faulty, or not fit for purpose.

### 4.2 Consumer Right to Cancel (14-Day Cooling Off Period)

If you are a consumer, you have the right to cancel your subscription within **14 days** of your initial purchase without giving any reason. This is in accordance with [Paddle's Checkout Buyer Terms](https://www.paddle.com/legal/checkout-buyer-terms).

**How to exercise your right to cancel:**

* Contact Paddle at [https://paddle.net/](https://paddle.net/) before the 14-day period expires
* Or contact us at [support@checktick.com](mailto:support@checktick.com)
* To meet the cancellation deadline, you must send your cancellation request before the 14-day period expires

**Effect of cancellation:**

* Paddle will reimburse all payments received from you
* Reimbursement will be made within 14 days of Paddle being informed of your cancellation
* The same payment method used for the original transaction will be used for the refund
* No fees will be charged for the reimbursement

**Important:**

* The right to cancel applies only to your **initial subscription**, not to automatic renewals
* There are **no refunds on unused subscription periods** for renewals

### 4.3 Additional Refund Circumstances

Beyond the 14-day consumer right to cancel, we may provide refunds in these circumstances (at our and Paddle's discretion):

**1. Service Unavailability**

* If the Service is unavailable for more than 72 consecutive hours due to our fault
* Refund: Pro-rated amount for downtime exceeding 72 hours

**2. Duplicate Charges**

* If you were charged multiple times for the same subscription period
* Refund: Full refund of duplicate charges

**3. Billing Errors**

* If you were charged incorrectly due to a system error
* Refund: Amount of the incorrect charge

**4. Technical Issues**

* If a critical bug prevents you from using core features for more than 7 days
* Refund: Pro-rated amount for the affected period
* Condition: Must be reported promptly and confirmed by our support team

### 4.4 Not Eligible for Refund

The following situations are **not** eligible for refunds:

* Features not meeting your expectations (unless they are genuinely broken)
* Your encryption keys being lost (this is your responsibility)
* Third-party payment processor fees (charged by Paddle)

### 4.5 Annual Subscriptions

For annual subscriptions:

* 14-day consumer right to cancel applies to first-time subscribers only
* After 14 days or once the service has been used, refunds are only available for service unavailability or technical issues
* Pro-rated refunds may be considered for exceptional circumstances at our discretion

### 4.6 Wire Transfer Payments

Orders where payments are made via wire transfer are not protected under the Consumer Credit Act and are therefore not eligible for a refund through standard processes. However, for transactions above £100 (or equivalent), you may be entitled to a refund at Paddle's discretion.
