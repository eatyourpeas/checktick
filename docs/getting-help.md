## Quick Decision Guide

### 🤔 I have a question or need help

**Use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/eatyourpeas/checktick/discussions)**

Discussions are perfect for:
- Questions about using CheckTick
- Getting help with setup or configuration
- Seeking advice on healthcare survey design
- Troubleshooting deployment issues
- General "How do I...?" questions
- Community support and sharing experiences

### 🐛 I found a bug or want a specific feature

**Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/eatyourpeas/checktick/issues)**

Issues are for:
- Bug reports with clear reproduction steps
- Specific feature requests with detailed requirements
- Documentation problems or improvements
- Security concerns (non-sensitive)

### 🔒 I found a security vulnerability

**Use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/eatyourpeas/checktick/security/advisories/new)**

For sensitive security issues that could be exploited.

## Detailed Guidelines

### When to Use Discussions

GitHub Discussions is our community forum for:

#### Questions and Support
- "How do I create multi-language surveys?"
- "What's the best way to handle patient consent?"
- "Why isn't my Docker setup working?"
- "How do I configure OIDC with my organisation?"
- "What question types work best for clinical audits?"

#### Sharing and Community
- Showcasing your CheckTick implementation
- Sharing healthcare use cases and success stories
- Discussing best practices for survey design
- Getting feedback on your survey structure
- Announcing community events or resources

#### Ideas and Brainstorming
- "It would be cool if CheckTick could..."
- Early-stage feature ideas that need refinement
- Discussing potential integrations
- Exploring new healthcare use cases
- Getting community input before formal feature requests

#### Announcements
- Release updates and changelogs
- New documentation or tutorials
- Community highlights
- Project roadmap discussions

### When to Use Issues

GitHub Issues are for specific, actionable items:

#### Bug Reports
Use the bug report template when:
- Something is broken or not working as expected
- You can provide clear steps to reproduce the problem
- There's an error message or unexpected behavior
- A feature that used to work is now broken

Include:
- Clear description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment details (browser, deployment type, etc.)
- Screenshots if helpful

#### Feature Requests
Use the feature request template when:
- You have a specific, well-defined feature in mind
- You can describe the healthcare use case clearly
- You've thought through the user story
- The feature would benefit the broader community

Include:
- Clear problem statement
- Proposed solution
- Healthcare/clinical context
- User story format
- Consider implementation complexity

#### Documentation Issues
Use the documentation template when:
- You found incorrect information
- Instructions are unclear or outdated
- Code examples don't work
- Missing documentation for a feature
- Broken links or formatting issues

### Examples

#### Discussion Examples ✅

**Good Discussion Topics:**
- "Best practices for creating patient satisfaction surveys"
- "How to handle multilingual surveys in a diverse patient population"
- "Sharing my experience deploying CheckTick for a clinical audit"
- "Ideas for integrating CheckTick with our hospital's EMR system"
- "Help with Docker deployment on AWS"

#### Issue Examples ✅

**Good Issue Topics:**
- "Survey export fails with large datasets (>1000 responses)"
- "Feature Request: Add support for conditional question logic"
- "Documentation: API authentication examples are outdated"
- "Bug: Encrypted fields not decrypting properly in Chrome"
- "Security: Rate limiting not working on login forms"

### Converting Between Discussions and Issues

Sometimes a discussion might evolve into a formal issue, or an issue might be better suited as a discussion:

- **Discussion → Issue**: When a question reveals a bug or crystallizes into a specific feature request
- **Issue → Discussion**: When an issue needs more community input or is too broad/vague

Maintainers can help with this conversion process.
