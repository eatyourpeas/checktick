# Vulnerability & Patch Log (Evidence 8.2.1)

**Monitoring Tools:** `pip-audit`, `ggshield` (via pre-commit), GitHub Dependabot, CodeQL.

## 1. Active Vulnerability Exceptions (Open & Ignored)

**Current Status:** Zero active exceptions. All previously ignored vulnerabilities have been remediated.

Our security scanning pipeline now operates with **zero vulnerability exceptions**. All dependencies are monitored in real-time and any new vulnerabilities will cause immediate CI/CD pipeline failure.

### Previously Active Exceptions (Now Resolved - January 2025)

The following vulnerabilities were previously silenced but have been **fully remediated** through dependency architecture improvements:

## 3. Automation & Triage Process

1. **Continuous Auditing:** Our `Security Scan` GitHub Action runs on every Push, Pull Request, and daily at 06:00 UTC.
2. **Hard Block on Production:** If `pip-audit` detects any vulnerability (Critical, High, Medium, or Low), the build fails and deployment is automatically blocked. **No exceptions are configured.**
3. **Isolated Security Tooling:** Security scanning tools (`ggshield`, `pre-commit`) run in isolated environments managed by pre-commit, preventing their dependencies from constraining production packages.
4. **Zero-Exception Policy:** Since January 2026, we maintain a zero-exception policy for vulnerability scanning. This ensures immediate visibility and remediation of any new vulnerabilities.
5. **Endpoint Sync:** Developers are required to run `poetry install` locally to synchronize their development environment with the latest patched versions in `poetry.lock`, preventing 'version drift' between local and production environments.

## 4. Architecture Improvements (January 2026)

**Key Change:** Separated security scanning tool dependencies from application runtime dependencies.

### Before:

- Security tools (`ggshield`) were installed via Poetry alongside application dependencies
- Security tools pinned critical dependencies (`cryptography`, `urllib3`) to outdated versions
- Required maintaining an exception list of 10+ vulnerabilities
- Could not update vulnerable dependencies without breaking security tools

### After:

- Security tools run in isolated pre-commit environments
- Production dependencies are free to update immediately when patches are released
- Zero vulnerabilities in production dependency tree
- Zero exceptions required in CI/CD pipeline
- Improved security posture and maintainability

This architectural change represents a significant improvement in our security monitoring capability while simultaneously reducing our vulnerability exposure.

## 5. CDN Artifact Handling & Integrity (January 2026)

**Change:** Updated automated CDN library refresh workflow to use `npm pack` as the canonical source for packaged JavaScript assets and to compute SRI from the package contents.

- **Reason:** Downloading files directly into the repository root from third-party CDNs caused temporary artifacts to remain after workflow runs (triggering security scanners such as CodeQL). Using `npm pack` ensures the registry is the authoritative source and the artifact bytes are reproducible.
- **What changed:** The `update-cdn-libraries` GitHub Action now:
	- Runs `npm pack <pkg>@<version>` in a temporary directory
	- Extracts the tarball, finds the minified asset, computes SHA-384 SRI from the file bytes, and atomically moves the asset into `checktick_app/static/js/`
	- Cleans up temporary files and directories using traps to avoid leaving files in the repository
- **Outcome:** SRI values are computed from the exact npm package bytes; temporary files no longer appear in the repo root; CodeQL false-positives reduced.

**Evidence:** PR #155 updates the workflow and documentation to reflect this change and updates `axe-core` to `4.11.1` with the new SRI hash.
