# Vulnerability & Patch Log (Evidence 8.2.1)

**Monitoring Tools:** `pip-audit`, `ggshield`, GitHub Dependabot, CodeQL.

## 1. Active Vulnerability Exceptions (Open & Ignored)

The following items are identified in our `Security Scan` GitHub Action. These are **silenced** in the CI/CD pipeline using the `--ignore-vuln` flag because they are transitive dependencies of our security tools (e.g., `ggshield`) and do not affect the production environment or patient data.

| Dependency | CVE / GHSA | Severity | Status / Mitigation | SIRO Signed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Transitive (via `ggshield`)** | GHSA-79v4-65xg-pq4g | High | **Environment Isolated.** Dependency of `ggshield` used only in CI. Not bundled in production image. | Yes |
| **Transitive (via `ggshield`)** | PYSEC-2024-187 | High | **Mitigated.** Upstream pin in `ggshield` prevents manual update. Scanned daily for upstream fixes. | Yes |
| `cryptography` | CVE-2024-12797 | Medium | **Assessed.** Vulnerable PKCS12 parsing is not utilized in our OIDC or JWT implementation logic. | Yes |
| `urllib3` | CVE-2025-50182 | High | **Network Mitigated.** Pinned by scanner. Risk mitigated by enforcing TLS 1.3 at the Cloudflare Edge. | Yes |
| `urllib3` | CVE-2024-3766 | High | **Network Mitigated.** Pinned by scanner. Risk mitigated by enforcing TLS 1.3 at the Cloudflare Edge. | Yes |

## 2. Recently Remediated Patches (Closed)

Verified history of security updates applied. Real-time evidence is available in the {{ platform_name }} GitHub repository under the `dependencies` label and closed issues.

| Date | Dependency | Version Change | Reason / Security Fix | Verified By |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 02/01/2026 | `requests` | 2.31.0 -> 2.32.0 | Fixed CVE-2024-3651 (Header parsing) | CTO |
| 28/12/2025 | `daisyui` | 4.x -> 5.4.7 | Dependency refresh & security hardening | CTO |
| 05/12/2025 | `jinja2` | 3.1.2 -> 3.1.4 | Fixed GHSA-h75v-3vv6-5qhc (XSS risk) | CTO |
| 12/11/2025 | `django` | 5.0.x -> 5.1.0 | Minor version upgrade to latest stable | CTO |

## 3. Automation & Triage Process

1. **Continuous Auditing:** Our `Security Scan` GitHub Action runs on every Push, Pull Request, and daily at 06:00 UTC.
2. **Hard Block on Production:** If `pip-audit` detects a 'Critical' or 'High' vulnerability that is **not** on the SIRO-approved exception list, the build fails and deployment is automatically blocked.
3. **Transitive Risk Review:** The CTO reviews the `--ignore-vuln` list monthly. When an upstream tool (like `ggshield`) releases an update that resolves a transitive vulnerability, the exception is removed and the dependency is updated.
4. **Endpoint Sync:** Developers are required to run `poetry install` locally to synchronize their development environment with the latest patched versions in `poetry.lock`, preventing 'version drift' between local and production environments.
