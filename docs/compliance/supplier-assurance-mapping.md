# Supplier Security Assurance Mapping

{{ platform_name }} has mapped the requirements of the NHS DSPT against the existing certifications held by our key suppliers to ensure 'equivalent or higher' protection.

| Supplier | Certification Held | DSPT Equivalent? | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Northflank** | ISO 27001 / SOC2 | **Yes** | Covers physical, network, and operational security. |
| **Mailgun** | SOC2 Type II | **Yes** | Covers security and confidentiality of data transit. |
| **GitHub** | ISO 27001 / SOC2 | **Yes** | Covers security of the code management pipeline. |

## Assurance Conclusion:

As these suppliers are audited by independent third-party firms (e.g., EY, Deloitte, KPMG) against international security frameworks, {{ platform_name }} is satisfied that they reach a higher data security standard than the baseline DSPT.
