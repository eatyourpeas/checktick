# Enhanced Acceptable Use Policy (System Administrators)

**Personnel:** {{ siro_name }}, {{ cto_name }}

As a System Administrator for {{ platform_name }}, I acknowledge that I have 'Privileged Access' to environments containing sensitive health data. I agree to the following enhanced standards:

1. **Identity Integrity:** I will never share administrative credentials. I will use individual accounts for all tasks on Northflank, GitHub, and PostgreSQL.
2. **MFA Mandate:** I will maintain active Multi-Factor Authentication on all devices and services used to access {{ platform_name }} infrastructure.
3. **Least Privilege:** I will only use administrative rights when necessary for a specific task and will 'drop' privileges for routine activities.
4. **Secure Environment:** I will only perform administrative actions from encrypted, company-authorized hardware.
5. **Transparency & Audit:** I acknowledge that all my administrative actions are logged and subject to review via the 'Internal Audit & Spot Check Log'.
6. **Data Ethics:** I will not access, modify, or export patient-identifiable data unless it is strictly required for a documented support or recovery task.

**Signed:**

* {{ siro_name }} - 29/12/2025
