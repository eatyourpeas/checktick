## 3. Communication & Awareness Strategy

Information is made available to staff through the following channels:

* **Slack Integration:** Automated alerts for Dependabot (vulnerabilities) and GitHub security events.
* **Policy Briefings:** All new or updated policies are discussed and signed off at the board level.

## 4. Evaluation of Effectiveness

We measure the impact of our TNA through:

1. **Compliance Spot-Checks:** Testing staff knowledge on the Incident Response Plan.
2. **Audit Logs:** Monitoring if staff are following secure access protocols (e.g., using MFA).
3. **Training Log:** Maintaining 100% completion status in `compliance/training.md`.
