### Internal Handling Instructions:

2. **Clock Start:** The 30-day statutory clock starts the day the request is received.
3. **Role Check:** - **If Account Data:** Handle as the Data Controller.
   - **If Survey/Patient Data:** Immediately notify the relevant Customer (Data Controller). We act as the Processor to fulfill their instructions.
4. **Final Review:** The DPO must review the response before it is sent to ensure no third-party PII is accidentally disclosed.
