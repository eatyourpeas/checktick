# Cyber Security Tabletop Exercise: Post-Action Report

**Date:** [Insert Date] 2025
**Participants:** {{ siro_name }} (SIRO), {{ cto_name }} (CTO)
**Scenario Source:** Based on NCSC Threat Intelligence (Supply Chain Vulnerabilities)

## Scenario Overview

A simulated 'Critical' vulnerability was identified in our production environment (Northflank). The scenario evolved to include unauthorized database access and a demand for ransom.

## Key Objectives Tested

1. **Role Clarity:** Does the SIRO know exactly when to trigger the 24-hour notification? (Result: Success)
2. **Technical Access:** Can the CTO access emergency backups if primary SSO is 'locked out'? (Result: Identified delay in hardware key retrieval)
3. **Communication:** Testing the wording of the initial 'Flash Alert' to NHS Trusts. (Result: Refined template)

## Lessons Learned & Action Plan

| Finding | Mitigation Action | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Emergency credentials took 15 mins to locate. | Centralized physical 'Break-Glass' kit created. | Complete |
| Initial alert was too technical. | Created a 'non-technical' summary template for Clinical Leads. | Complete |
| 72-hour ICO window understood. | Re-confirmed DSPT reporting tool login credentials. | Complete |
