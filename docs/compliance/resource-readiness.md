    * 2048-bit SSH keys for server access (stored on FIPS 140-2 encrypted hardware).
2. **Documentation (Offline Access):**
    * PDF copy of the Business Continuity Plan.
    * Technical "Vault Unseal" guide.
    * NHS Trust emergency contact list.
3. **Communication Tools:**
    * Secondary mobile devices for MFA and hotspotting.
    * Out-of-band communication channel (Signal/Phone) for directors.
4. **Personnel Redundancy:**
    * The SIRO is trained on the basic 'Container Restart' and 'Snapshot Restore' procedures in Northflank to act as a backup to the CTO.
