# Removable Media Policy

**Scope:** All {{ platform_name }} staff and administrative devices.

## 1. General Principle

{{ platform_name }} is a cloud-hosted platform. To maintain the security of our customers' data, no hosted data (Patient Identifiable Information or Survey Responses) shall ever be stored on removable media.

## 2. Prohibitions

* **USB Drives / SD Cards:** The use of USB flash drives or SD cards for the storage or transport of hosted data is strictly prohibited.
* **External Hard Drives:** Local backups of the production database to physical external hard drives are prohibited. All backups are managed via encrypted, redundant cloud storage within our UK-sovereign zone.

## 3. Data Controller Guidance

While {{ platform_name }} provides the facility for Data Controllers (customers) to export their data, our internal policy ensures that {{ platform_name }} staff do not facilitate these exports via physical media. All data transfers must occur over secure, encrypted (HTTPS) channels.

## 4. Exceptions

The only permitted use of removable media is for non-data tasks, such as initial hardware setup or OS recovery, and these devices must never be used to interface with the production data environment.
