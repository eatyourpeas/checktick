# Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) - Procedure

**Version:** 1.0
**Owner:** {{ siro_name }} (DPO)

## 1. When to Conduct a DPIA

A DPIA is mandatory at {{ platform_name }} for any project or feature that:

* Involves the processing of health data (Special Category).
* Introduces new technology (e.g., integrating a new AI/LLM component).
* Involves large-scale processing or profiling.
* Matches any of the ICO's "High Risk" criteria.

## 2. The Step-by-Step Process (ICO Aligned)

1. **Screening:** Use the ICO Screening Checklist to determine if a full DPIA is required.
2. **Description:** Document the nature, scope, context, and purpose of the processing.
3. **Consultation:** Consult with {{ cto_name }} (CTO) on technical risks and, where appropriate, data subjects or clinical partners.
4. **Necessity & Proportionality:** Verify that the processing is necessary for the goal and that no less intrusive method exists.
5. **Risk Identification:** Identify risks to individuals, including the likelihood and severity of impact.
6. **Mitigation:** Identify measures to reduce risk (e.g., encryption, data minimization).
7. **Sign-off:** The SIRO/DPO must approve the residual risk.

## 3. Integration with Risk Management

Any risks identified in a DPIA that cannot be fully mitigated are transferred to the **Data Security & Protection Risk Register** for ongoing monitoring at board level.

## 4. Review

DPIAs are live documents and must be reviewed:

* Every 12 months.
* Whenever a significant change is made to the data flow or technology stack.
