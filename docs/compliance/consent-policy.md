# Lawful Basis & Consent Statement

**Date:** 29/11/2025
**Reviewer:** {{ siro_name }}

## 1. Our Role

{{ platform_name }} is primarily a **Data Processor** for patient-related health data. We process this data strictly on the instructions of our customers (Healthcare Providers).

## 2. Lawful Basis for Processing

| Data Category | Data Subject | Lawful Basis (GDPR) | Lawful Basis (Common Law) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Account Info** | App Users | Art 6(1)(b) - Contract | N/A (Business data) |
| **Health Responses** | Patients | Art 6(1)(b) - Contract (Processor) | Managed by Controller (Consent/Public Task) |
| **Payment Info** | App Users | Handled by GoCardless | N/A |

## 3. Transparency & Choice

While the Data Controller (the healthcare org) chooses the legal basis for their survey, {{ platform_name }} provides the following technical safeguards:

* **Participant Summaries:** Mandatory header fields for surveys to explain data use.
* **Withdrawal of Data:** Built-in tools for users to delete specific responses upon patient request (Right to Erasure).
* **Anonymization:** Feature to collect responses without PII, removing the "Confidentiality" burden where possible.
