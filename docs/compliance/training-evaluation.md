# Training Evaluation Report: 2025

**Reviewer:** {{ siro_name }} (SIRO) | **Date:** [Insert Date]

## 1. Evaluation of Knowledge & Behaviour

We conducted a simulated 'Incident Response Walkthrough' on [Date].

* **Scenario:** Discovery of an unauthorized IP address attempting to access the production database.
* **Outcome:** Personnel correctly identified the 'Containment' steps in the IRP and verified the VPC isolation logs within 5 minutes.
* **Result:** **Pass.** Staff demonstrate appropriate knowledge of high-stakes security procedures.

## 2. Incident Linkage

* **Total Incidents (Last 12 Months):** [X]
* **Incidents caused by Lack of Awareness:** 0
* **Analysis:** Our 'MFA-by-default' training has successfully prevented any credential-based unauthorized access attempts.

## 3. Evidence of Information Usage

* **Platform:** GitHub Documentation Portal.
* **Metric:** All updates to the `Security Overview` and `Data Policy` are reviewed and signed off by both partners via Pull Requests.
* **Finding:** The version history of our `/compliance` folder demonstrates that policies are being actively refined and used as living documents rather than static files.
