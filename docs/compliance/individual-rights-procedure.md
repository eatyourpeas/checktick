# Procedure: Handling Individual Rights Requests

**Version:** 1.0
**Owner:** DPO ({{ cto_name }})

## 1. Scope

This procedure applies to all requests made under UK GDPR Articles 15-22, including Subject Access Requests (SARs), Right to Erasure, and the Right to Object.

## 2. Receipt of Request

* Requests may arrive via [support@checktick.uk](mailto:support@checktick.uk) or [dpo@checktick.uk](mailto:dpo@checktick.uk).
* Any staff member receiving a request must forward it to the DPO within 24 hours.

## 3. Verification & Triage

1. **Identify the Subject:** Verify the requester's identity (e.g., via registered email or transaction ID).
2. **Identify the Role:** * If the request concerns **Account Data**, {{ platform_name }} (Controller) handles it.
   * If it concerns **Survey Data**, we notify the Customer (Controller) and assist them in fulfilling the request.

## 4. Handling an Objection (Article 21)

If an individual objects to processing:

* **Step 1:** Stop any non-essential processing of that specific data record immediately.
* **Step 2:** Assess if there are "compelling legitimate grounds" that override the objection (rare in healthcare surveys).
* **Step 3:** If the objection is valid, delete or anonymize the data as requested.
* **Step 4:** Confirm completion to the individual within 30 days.

## 5. Logging

All requests are logged in our **Data Rights Request Tracker** (Internal) including date of receipt, action taken, and date of completion.
