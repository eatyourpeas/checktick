## 1. Scope

This procedure applies to all new and existing suppliers identified as 'Critical' or 'Data Processing' in the {{ platform_name }} Supplier Register.

## 2. Pre-Contract Due Diligence

Before a contract is signed or a service is utilized, the CTO/SIRO must verify:

1. **Security Accreditations:** Does the supplier hold ISO 27001, SOC2 Type II, or Cyber Essentials?
2. **Data Residency:** Where is the data stored? (Preference for UK/EEA).
3. **Data Protection Agreement (DPA):** Does the supplier offer an Article 28 compliant DPA?

## 3. Approved Accreditation Standards

{{ platform_name }} accepts the following certifications as evidence of 'appropriate security':

* **ISO/IEC 27001:2013 or 2022** (Information Security Management)
* **SOC2 Type II** (Security, Confidentiality, and Availability)
* **Cyber Essentials / Cyber Essentials Plus** (UK Government Standard)
* **CSA STAR** (Cloud Security Alliance)

## 4. Annual Audit

During the Q1 Security Review, the SIRO will:
