# Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) Summary

**Project:** {{ platform_name }} Health Survey Platform
**Date:** 29/12/2025
**Lead:** {{ siro_name }}

### 1. Description of Processing

{{ platform_name }} processes health-related survey data on behalf of healthcare providers. Data is collected via web forms, encrypted in transit (TLS), and stored encrypted at rest (AES-256).

### 2. Necessity and Proportionality

Processing is limited to the minimum data required for the survey creator's specific health goal. Our auto-deletion policy (6-24 months) ensures we do not hold data longer than necessary.

### 3. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| Risk Identified | Level | Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unauthorized Access** | High | Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), MFA for admins, and Scoped API keys. |
| **Data Breach in Transit** | Med | Strict TLS 1.2+ requirement; no insecure HTTP allowed. |
| **Loss of Encryption Keys** | Med | Distributed Vault Unseal keys and documented recovery procedures. |
| **Server Failure** | Low | Daily encrypted backups in Northflank UK region; RTO < 1 hour. |

### 4. Outcome

The residual risk is considered **Low**. All processing is conducted within the UK, and high-level encryption is applied at every stage of the data lifecycle.
