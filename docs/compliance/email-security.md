# Email Authentication & Anti-Spoofing Policy

## 1. Protocol Configuration

To protect the {{ platform_name }} brand and prevent phishing attacks against our partners (NHS Trusts), the following DNS records are maintained:

### 1.1 Sender Policy Framework (SPF)

* **Status:** Active
* **Configuration:** Includes all authorized IP ranges for personal email provider and Mailgun.
* **Policy:** Set to `~all` (Softfail) or `-all` (Fail) to discourage unauthorized senders.

### 1.2 DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)

* **Status:** Active
* **Implementation:** 2048-bit RSA keys generated by Mailgun and our corporate email provider.
* **Rotation:** Keys are rotated if a provider is changed or a compromise is suspected.

### 1.3 DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication)

* **Status:** Active
* **Policy:** Currently set to `v=DMARC1; p=none;` (Monitoring) or `p=quarantine;` (Enforcement).
* **Reporting:** Aggregated reports (RUA) are sent to [Your Email] to monitor for spoofing attempts.
* **Policy** `v=DMARC1; p=quarantine;` (Enforcement active)
* **Justification** This ensures that unauthenticated emails claiming to be from checktick.uk are moved to the recipient's spam folder, protecting NHS partners from phishing.

## 2. Maintenance

* **Quarterly Review:** During spot checks, the CTO verifies that no unauthorized services have been added to the SPF record.
* **Decommissioning:** When a third-party service is no longer used, its entry is immediately removed from the SPF and DKIM records.

## 3. Inbound Email Security (Filtering)

To protect staff and the integrity of our internal systems, we utilize the following inbound controls:

### 3.1 Advanced Threat Protection

* **Solution:** Personal email accounts with built-in spam filtering and phishing protection.
* **Attachment Scanning:** All attachments are scanned for malware signatures before being made available to the user.
* **Link Protection:** URLs in emails are checked against real-time blocklists (Google Safe Browsing).

### 3.2 Inbound Authentication (DMARC Enforcement)

Our mail system is configured to perform the following checks on every incoming email:

1. **SPF Check:** Does the sending IP match the sender's SPF record?
2. **DKIM Check:** Does the cryptographic signature match the sender's public key?
3. **DMARC Action:** If either check fails, we follow the sender's published DMARC policy (p=none, quarantine, or reject).

### 3.3 Quarterly Review

The CTO reviews the 'Spam/Phishing' dashboard of our email provider quarterly to identify if the organization is being targeted by specific campaigns.
