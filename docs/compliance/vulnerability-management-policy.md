# Vulnerability Management Policy: {{ platform_name }}

**Version:** 1.1
**Last Reviewed by SIRO:** 02/01/2026
**Approval Status:** Approved

## 1. Purpose

This policy outlines how {{ platform_name }} identifies, assesses, and remediates security vulnerabilities within our software stack and infrastructure to protect health and care data.

## 2. Software Stack Monitoring

{{ platform_name }} utilizes a modern Python/Django stack. We monitor for vulnerabilities at three levels:

* **Application Code:** Static Analysis (CodeQL), manual code reviews, and automated linting.
* **Dependencies:** Continuous monitoring of Python packages (PyPI) and JavaScript libraries.
* **Infrastructure:** Monitoring of Northflank container images and Ubuntu base OS layers.

## 3. Automated Detection & Intelligence

We utilize a multi-feed monitoring strategy to ensure 360-degree visibility:

* **GitHub Dependabot:** 24/7 monitoring of repository dependencies.
* **pip-audit:** Integrated into CI/CD for daily deep-scans of the Python environment.
* **GitGuardian (ggshield):** Real-time detection of hardcoded secrets or credentials.
* **NCSC Early Warning Service:** National-level intelligence on infrastructure and IP-based threats (UK Sovereign feed).
* **Alerting:** Security alerts are delivered immediately to the CTO and SIRO via secure channels.

## 4. Remediation Timelines

| Severity | Definition | Target Remediation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Critical** | Immediate risk of data breach. | Within 48 hours |
| **High** | Significant risk to data integrity. | Within 14 days |
| **Medium/Low** | Minimal impact/risk. | Within 30 days / Next release |

*Note: If a vendor patch is unavailable for a Critical vulnerability, {{ platform_name }} will implement mitigating controls (e.g., Northflank Network Isolation or service suspension) within the 48-hour window.*

## 5. Patch Management Process

1. **Identification:** Alert received via automated feeds (GitHub/NCSC/Audit).
2. **Assessment:** The CTO assesses the "reachability" of the vulnerability in the {{ platform_name }} environment.
3. **Testing:** Patches are applied in a staging environment and verified against the automated test suite.
4. **Deployment:** Successful patches are deployed to production via our automated Northflank pipeline.
5. **Verification:** Production logs and `pip-audit` logs are checked to confirm the fix is active.

## 6. Zero-Day Vulnerabilities

In the event of a high-profile "Zero-Day," the CTO will initiate an emergency review of all infrastructure components within 24 hours. Emergency remediations are documented in the *Vulnerability & Patch Log* and reviewed by the SIRO.

## 7. Unsupported Software & Technical Debt

* **No EOL Software:** {{ platform_name }} does not use any software, OS, or libraries that are no longer supported.
* **Sovereign Compliance:** We prioritize UK-resident base images (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) and maintain 100% estate support as evidenced in our *Asset Register*.
* **Deprecation Monitoring:** The CTO reviews the stack quarterly. Any component nearing 'End of Life' is scheduled for upgrade at least 3 months in advance.
