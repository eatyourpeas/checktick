### 6.4 Data Subject Escalation and Data Quarantine

If a survey respondent contacts CheckTick directly with a data subject request (e.g., access, erasure, objection):

   * Report your conduct to the Information Commissioner's Office
6. **Encrypted Data**: Where data is encrypted with your keys, quarantine means restricting platform access; we cannot modify encrypted content without your cooperation
