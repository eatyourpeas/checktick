# Documentation

CheckTick is an open source project for clinicians to run surveys, audits or research, especially in the UK.

The average clinician in the NHS has plenty of research ideas, quality improvement or audit project opportunities, but most will not have any departmental money to spend on carrying them out. If any of these involve running a survey that involves patients, the only platforms that can host them sit within Universities and are out of reach for the average person running a small project in their spare time.

For clinicians doing surveys or questionnaires that don't involve sensitive patient data, still the available solutions are not tailored to health care.

CheckTick meets all these needs. It allows users to build their own questions from a range of question types, including a range of prebuilt question groups. For example, if you are surveying doctors and you want to know where they work, you can use the Professional Details - fields prepopulated with all the hosital trusts in the UK. Need an input that validates an NHS Number or postcode? You can use the custom Patient Details group. CheckTick supports hundreds of NHS Dictionary datasets besides, all with standard names and values; from standardised lists of blood groups, to ethnicities to medical specialities. Users can publish their own lists to share with others, or Organisation users can build their own lists specific to where they work.

There are question groups also that are hosted by CheckTick - any validated, published group of questions (subject to copyright), for example the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), can be dropped into a survey. No need to enter all those questions in again.

There are a range of different was to create surveys. Most users are familiar with builders where questions types are dragged onto a canvas. CheckTick offers this together with branching where users can change the questions offered based on previous answers. But CheckTick also has a Text Editor - users can type the questions in as a list, or paste them in from somewhere else to create a survey. Or, use the AI Assistant which can suggest questions and generate the survey automatically.

In addition to the platform, there is an API. All the same endpoints can be accessed this way. In both cases security is tight, with logging, and a range of safeguards to lock down access. There is a full range of tests to support this.

This documentation should answer questions you may have as a user, but also covers particular those aspects where you are looking to host CheckTick yourself. It is deliberately customisable, so you can change the styles and themes, or the email server you use.
