This document explains how organisation, team, and survey-level user management works, including roles, permissions, invitations, and security protections.

## Account Types

There are three types of user contexts in the system:

- **Individual users**: Users who create surveys without an organisation or team. Individual users can only create and manage their own surveys and **cannot share surveys or invite collaborators**.
- **Team members**: Users who belong to a team. Teams provide collaboration for 5-20 users with shared billing and role-based access.
- **Organisation members**: Users who belong to an organisation. Organisations can host both individual members AND teams, with permissions managed by organisation admins.

## Team Size Limits

Teams have capacity limits based on their subscription tier:

| Team Size | Maximum Members |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Small     | 5 members       |
| Medium    | 10 members      |
| Large     | 20 members      |

**Note**: Pending invitations count toward the team capacity limit. For example, a Small team with 3 members and 2 pending invitations has reached its 5-member limit.

**Organisation teams**: Organisations can create unlimited teams with unlimited members.

## Roles and Scopes

There are three membership scopes with separate roles:

### Organisation Membership (OrganisationMembership)

- **admin**: Full administrative control over the organisation context, including managing org members, teams, and surveys within the organisation.
- **creator**: Can create and manage their own surveys; read-only visibility to organisation content is up to app policy, but creators do NOT manage org members or teams.
- **viewer**: Read-only role for organisation context where applicable; cannot manage org members or teams.
- **data_custodian**: Specialised role for data governance responsibilities.

### Team Membership (TeamMembership)

- **admin**: Can manage team members, settings, and all team surveys. If the team is within an organisation, organisation admins also have admin rights.
- **creator**: Can create and edit surveys within the team.
- **viewer**: Read-only access to team surveys.

**Team hierarchy**: Organisation admin > Team admin > Survey owner

**Unique constraint**: Each user can only have one role per team `(team, user)`.

**Role persistence**: Team roles remain intact if a team migrates to an Organisation.

### Survey Membership (SurveyMembership)

**Only available for organisation surveys**

- **creator**: Can manage members for that specific survey and edit the survey.
- **viewer**: Can view the survey content and results according to app policy; cannot manage survey members.

## Additional Implicit Authorities

- **Survey owner**: For organisation/team surveys, always has full control over the survey, including member management for that survey.
- **Organisation admin**: Has admin rights for all surveys that belong to their organisation, including surveys in teams hosted by the organisation. Has supreme access.
- **Team admin**: Has admin rights for surveys within their team. Can manage team members and team surveys.

## Single-Organisation Model

- A user can be an ADMIN of at most one organisation. The "User management" hub focuses on that single org context.
- A user can be an ADMIN of multiple teams.
- A user can have multiple roles simultaneously: PRO account + team member + organisation member.

## Permission Matrix (Summary)

- **Manage org members** (add/update/remove): Organisation admin only
- **Manage team members** (add/update/remove): Team admin OR organisation admin (if team is in their org)
- **Manage survey members** (add/update/remove): **Organisation/team surveys only** - Survey owner, organisation admin (if applicable), team admin (if applicable), or survey creator for that survey
- **View survey**: Owner, org admin (if applicable), team admin (if applicable), any survey member (creator/viewer)
- **Individual users**: Cannot share surveys or manage survey members

## Guardrails

- Organisation admins cannot remove themselves from their own admin role via the SSR UI or the API. Attempts are rejected.
- Individual users (surveys without organisation or team) cannot access user management endpoints or share their surveys.
- SSR UI supports email-based lookup and creation for convenience. The API endpoints expect explicit user IDs for membership resources; scoped user creation endpoints exist to create a user in a given org, team, or survey.

## Inviting Users

When adding a user to an organisation or team, the system handles two scenarios:

### Existing Users

If the email address belongs to an existing user account, they are added immediately with the specified role. The user will see the organisation/team in their dashboard on their next login.

### New Users (Invitation System)

If the email address does not match any existing account, an **invitation** is sent:

1. **Invitation email**: The user receives a branded email inviting them to join the organisation or team
2. **Signup link**: The email contains a link to create an account
3. **Automatic membership**: When the user signs up with that email address, they are automatically added to the organisation/team with the invited role
4. **Expiration**: Invitations expire after 7 days

### Managing Pending Invitations

The User Management Hub displays pending invitations alongside existing members. Admins can:

- **Resend**: Send the invitation email again (useful if the original was missed)
- **Cancel**: Remove the pending invitation

Pending invitations are shown with a warning indicator and include:
- The invited email address
- The role they will be assigned
- How long ago the invitation was sent
- Resend and Cancel buttons

### Capacity and Invitations

For teams with size limits:
- Pending invitations count toward the team capacity
- You cannot invite more users than your remaining capacity
- Example: A Small team (5 max) with 3 members and 1 pending invitation can only invite 1 more user

### Invitation Models

The system uses two invitation models:

- **TeamInvitation**: For team-level invitations
- **OrgInvitation**: For organisation-level invitations

Both track: email, role, invited_by, created_at, expires_at, and accepted_at (set when the user signs up).

## SSR Management Pages

**Note**: User management pages are only accessible for organisation/team surveys. Individual users cannot share their surveys or access these pages.

### User Management Hub: `/surveys/manage/users/`

Shows:

1. **Organisation section** (if you're an org admin):
   - Your organisation and all its members
   - Quick-add form to add users to the organisation by email and role
   - Pending invitations with resend/cancel options
   - View all teams within the organisation

2. **Teams you manage section** (if you're a team admin):
   - All teams where you have admin role
   - Add/remove team members
   - Assign roles to team members
   - View team capacity (e.g., 5/10/20 members) including pending invitations
   - Pending invitations with resend/cancel options

3. **Users by survey section**:
   - Shows surveys and their members
   - Quick-add form to assign users to surveys by email and role

Actions:

- Prevents an org admin from removing themselves as an admin
- Sends invitation emails when adding users who don't have accounts
- All actions are audit-logged
- Shows UK spelling: "Organisation" throughout

### Organisation Users: `/surveys/org/<org_id>/users/`

- Admins can add or update members by email, change roles, and remove users
- Non-admins receive 403
- Actions are audit-logged

### Survey Users: `/surveys/{slug}/users/`

- **Only available for organisation surveys**. Individual users cannot access this page.
- Owners, org admins (if the survey belongs to their org), and survey creators can add/update/remove survey members.
- Survey viewers see a read-only list.
- Actions are audit-logged.

## API endpoints

Authentication: All endpoints below require JWT. Include "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>".

### Organisation memberships

- List: GET /api/org-memberships/
- Create: POST /api/org-memberships/
- Update: PUT/PATCH /api/org-memberships/{id}/
- Delete: DELETE /api/org-memberships/{id}/

Scope and permissions:

- Queryset is restricted to organisations where the caller is an admin.
- Create/Update/Delete require admin role in the target organisation.
- Delete: additionally prevents an org admin from removing their own admin membership.
- Unauthorized or out-of-scope access returns 403 Forbidden. Missing/invalid JWT returns 401 Unauthorized.

Serializer fields:

- id, organisation, user, username (read-only), role, created_at (read-only)

### Survey memberships

**Note**: Survey memberships are only available for organisation surveys. Individual users cannot create or manage survey memberships.

- List: GET /api/survey-memberships/
- Create: POST /api/survey-memberships/
- Update: PUT/PATCH /api/survey-memberships/{id}/
- Delete: DELETE /api/survey-memberships/{id}/

Scope and permissions:

- Queryset contains only memberships for surveys the caller can view (owner, org-admin for the survey's org, or the caller is a member of the survey).
- Create/Update/Delete require manage permission on the survey (owner, org admin for the survey's org, or survey creator).
- **Individual users (surveys without organisation) will receive 403 Forbidden when attempting to manage memberships.**
- Unauthorized or out-of-scope access returns 403; missing/invalid JWT returns 401.

Serializer fields:

- id, survey, user, username (read-only), role, created_at (read-only)

### Scoped user creation

To support flows where an admin/creator wants to add a person who may not yet exist:

- Create user within an org context (org admin only):
  - POST /api/scoped-users/org/{org_id}/create

- Create user within a survey context (survey owner/org admin/creator):
  - POST /api/scoped-users/survey/{survey_id}/create
  - **Only available for organisation surveys. Individual users will receive 403 Forbidden.**

Request schema:

- email (string, required)
- password (string, optional)

Behavior:

- If a user with the given email already exists, it is reused; otherwise a new user is created with username=email. Password is required only when creating a new user (optional if reusing).
- On success, returns the user's id/username/email and adds them as a Viewer in the specified scope by default (org Viewer or survey Viewer).
- Permission checks mirror the membership rules above. Unauthorized attempts receive 403.

Note: The SSR UI allows searching by email and will create or reuse users accordingly, with audit logging. If you need similar behavior via API, use the scoped user creation endpoints described here.

## Audit logging

Membership actions performed via the SSR UI are recorded in AuditLog with:

- actor, scope (organisation or survey), organisation/survey context, action (add/update/remove), target_user, metadata (e.g., role), timestamp

These records enable traceability of who changed which memberships and when.

## Security notes

- JWT is required for API access. Missing/invalid tokens result in 401; valid tokens without sufficient privileges result in 403.
- SSR uses session auth with CSRF protection and enforces permissions via centralized helpers.
- Organisation admins cannot remove themselves as admins via the UI or the API; requests to remove self-admin are rejected.
- Sensitive demographics remain encrypted per-survey and are unaffected by membership operations.

### Account Deletion Security

For security and data integrity reasons, account deletion is restricted:

- **User account deletion**: Only superusers can delete user accounts through the Django Admin interface (`/admin/`).
- **Regular users cannot delete their own accounts** to prevent accidental data loss and maintain audit trails.
- **Organisation deletion**: Only superusers can delete organisations through the Django Admin interface.
- **Survey deletion**: Survey owners and organisation admins can delete surveys they manage, following proper confirmation workflows.

**Rationale**: User and organisation deletion can have cascading effects that permanently remove data belonging to multiple users. This restriction ensures:

1. **Data protection**: Prevents accidental loss of surveys and responses that may be shared with other users
2. **Audit compliance**: Maintains proper audit trails for account management actions
3. **Security**: Prevents malicious or compromised accounts from destroying organisational data
4. **Intentionality**: Ensures deletion decisions are made by administrators with full context

**For users needing account deletion**: Contact your system administrator, who can safely perform the deletion through the admin interface after confirming the impact on shared data.

### Managing Staff Departures (Leaver's Process)

To maintain the security of your survey data, Organisation Owners must revoke access for any staff member who leaves the project or the organisation. This can be performed by organisation administrators through the user portal. This action is immediate and will be logged in your organisation's Audit Trail.

## Organisation Administration Workflow

This section describes the typical workflow for managing organisations and their teams.

### Creating an Organisation

Organisations are created by **platform administrators (superusers)** through the Platform Admin portal. The typical workflow is:

1. **Navigate to Platform Admin**: Click your avatar in the top-right corner → Admin Tools → Platform Admin
2. **Create Organisation**: Click "Create New Organisation" and fill in:
   - **Name**: The organisation's display name
   - **Owner Email**: The email address of the organisation owner (must have an existing account)
   - **Billing Type**: Choose from Per Seat, Flat Rate, Invoice, or Free
   - **Pricing**: Set the price per seat or flat rate price as appropriate
   - **Max Seats**: Optionally limit the number of members (leave blank for unlimited)
   - **Billing Contact**: Email address for billing communications
   - **Notes**: Internal notes about billing arrangements

3. **Send Invitation**: After creating the organisation, generate an invite link and optionally send an email to the owner. The owner can then complete setup and configure their organisation.

4. **Monitor Status**: View organisation status in the dashboard - pending setup, active, past due, etc.

### Organisation Owner Setup

When an organisation owner receives their invitation:

1. They click the setup link in the email (or are given the link by the admin)
2. They log in with their account credentials
3. They review and confirm their organisation settings
4. They can immediately start inviting members and creating teams

### Creating Teams Within an Organisation

Organisation owners and admins can create teams within their organisation:

1. **Navigate to User Management**: Go to `/surveys/manage/users/`
2. **Create Team**: In the Organisation section, click "Create Team"
3. **Configure Team**:
   - **Name**: The team's display name
   - **Size**: Choose Small (5), Medium (10), Large (20), or Custom
   - **Max Surveys**: Set the maximum number of surveys the team can create

4. **Invite Team Members**: Add members by email with appropriate roles (Admin, Creator, Viewer)

### Team Hierarchy and Permissions

When teams are created within an organisation:

- **Organisation admins** automatically have admin access to all teams
- **Team admins** can only manage their specific team
- **Team members** can collaborate on surveys within the team
- **Billing** is managed at the organisation level, not per-team

### Managing Organisation Billing

Platform administrators can manage billing through the Platform Admin portal:

1. **Edit Organisation**: Click on an organisation → Edit
2. **Update Billing**:
   - Change billing type (Per Seat, Flat Rate, Invoice, Free)
   - Adjust pricing
   - Update max seats
   - Modify billing contact

3. **Track Usage**: View current seat usage, survey counts, and estimated revenue

### Deactivating an Organisation

To deactivate an organisation (e.g., for non-payment):

1. Navigate to the organisation detail page in Platform Admin
2. Click "Deactivate Organisation"
3. The organisation and all its members will be marked inactive
4. Members will no longer be able to access organisation resources
5. The organisation can be reactivated later if needed

## Superuser Portal: Platform Statistics

Superusers have access to a comprehensive statistics dashboard at `/platform-admin/stats/`.

### Accessing Platform Statistics

1. Click your avatar in the top-right corner
2. Navigate to Admin Tools → Platform Admin
3. Click "Statistics" in the sidebar or navigate to `/platform-admin/stats/`

### Available Statistics

#### Billing Breakdown

The statistics page shows a breakdown of organisations by billing type:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Per Seat | Number of organisations using per-seat billing |
| Flat Rate | Number of organisations with fixed monthly pricing |
| Invoice | Number of organisations on manual invoice billing |
| Free | Number of free/trial organisations |

#### Status Breakdown

View organisations by subscription status:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Pending | Organisations awaiting owner setup |
| Active | Fully operational organisations |
| Past Due | Organisations with overdue payments |
| Canceled | Cancelled subscriptions |
| Trialing | Organisations in trial period |

#### Revenue Estimates

The dashboard provides estimated monthly revenue calculations:

- **Per-seat revenue**: Sum of (seats × price_per_seat) for all per-seat orgs
- **Flat-rate revenue**: Sum of all flat_rate_price values
- **Total estimated MRR**: Combined monthly recurring revenue

**Note**: Invoice-based organisations are not included in automated revenue calculations as their billing is handled manually.

#### Usage Metrics

Additional metrics available:

- Total number of organisations
- Total members across all organisations
- Total teams across all organisations
- Total surveys across all organisations
- Organisations requiring attention (past due, over seat limit, etc.)

### Dashboard Overview

The main Platform Admin dashboard (`/platform-admin/`) provides:

- **Quick Stats**: Total orgs, members, teams, surveys
- **Recent Organisations**: Latest organisations created
- **Attention Required**: Organisations needing admin intervention (past due, inactive, etc.)
- **Quick Actions**: Create new organisation, view all organisations, view statistics

### Rate Limiting

Platform admin endpoints are rate-limited to prevent abuse:

| Action | Rate Limit |
|--------|------------|
| View dashboard/details | 30 requests/hour |
| List organisations | 20 requests/hour |
| Create/edit organisations | 10 requests/hour |

---

## Testing

The test suite includes:

- JWT auth enforcement (missing/invalid tokens, refresh flow)
- API permission tests for list/detail/update/seed
- SSR portal tests for org/survey user management behaviors and permission boundaries
- Platform admin permission tests (superuser-only access, rate limiting)

All tests are designed to ensure that protections are consistent and robust across SSR and API.
